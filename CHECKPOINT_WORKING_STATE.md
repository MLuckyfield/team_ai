# CHECKPOINT: Working Landing Page + n8n Platform - RESTORED

**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ FULLY WORKING (Restored after OpenSign breaking issue)

## Current Deployment

**Live URL**: https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/

### Working Services:
1. **Landing Page**: ✅ https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/
2. **n8n Workflow Automation**: ✅ https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/n8n/

## Architecture

```
nginx (port 80) → Routes traffic:
├── / → Landing Page (Node.js on port 8080)
└── /n8n/ → n8n (port 5678)
```

## Key Files (Working Configuration):

### Dockerfile.n8n-simple
- Uses `node:20-slim` base image
- Installs nginx, curl, and n8n@1.70.1
- Properly configured startup script with PORT=8080 for landing page
- nginx configuration: `nginx.n8n-simple.conf`

### nginx.n8n-simple.conf
- Routes `/` to landing page backend (port 8080)
- Routes `/n8n/` to n8n backend (port 5678)
- Includes WebSocket support for n8n

### unified-minimal-platform.yaml
- Digital Ocean App Platform configuration
- Uses `Dockerfile.n8n-simple`
- Auto-deployment enabled from git main branch

## Digital Ocean Details
- **App ID**: `6c9d34e6-ab45-457d-9795-eacc4c353274`
- **Active Deployment ID**: `616b1564-1500-4662-9e63-1523a6525be2`
- **Instance Size**: basic-xxs
- **Cost**: ~$21/month

## Git State
- Repository: `MLuckyfield/team_ai`
- Branch: `main`
- Last working commit: "EMERGENCY FIX: Force rebuild to restore working n8n + landing page deployment"

## What Works:
- ✅ Landing page serving HTML with Express (200 OK)
- ✅ n8n fully functional with database migrations completed (200 OK)
- ✅ SSL/HTTPS certificates
- ✅ Auto-deployment from git pushes
- ✅ Health checks pass
- ✅ Proper routing and proxy configuration

## Issues Resolved:
- ✅ Fixed Docker cache issue that was using wrong Dockerfile
- ✅ Used `doctl apps update --spec` to force correct specification
- ✅ Confirmed no OpenSign components running (clean state)

## Next Step: Add OpenSign Carefully
Ready to add OpenSign as third service at `/opensign/` path **WITHOUT breaking existing services**.

### Approach:
1. Create new Dockerfile that extends current working setup
2. Add OpenSign routing to nginx config
3. Test locally before deployment 
4. Deploy incrementally
