# CHECKPOINT: Landing Page + n8n Working, OpenSign Route Investigation

**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Partial Success - Need to fix OpenSign route

## Current Deployment

**Live URL**: https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/

### Working Services:
1. **Landing Page**: ✅ https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/ (200 OK)
2. **n8n Workflow Automation**: ✅ https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/n8n/ (200 OK)

### Partially Working:
3. **OpenSign Route**: ❌ https://unified-minimal-platform-5p64u.ondigitalocean.app/opensign/ (404 Not Found)

## Architecture

```
nginx (port 80) → Routes traffic:
├── / → Landing Page (Node.js on port 8080)
└── /n8n/ → n8n (port 5678)
```

## Key Files (Working Configuration):

### Dockerfile.n8n-simple
- Uses `node:20-slim` base image
- Installs nginx, curl, and n8n@1.70.1
- Properly configured startup script with PORT=8080 for landing page
- nginx configuration: `nginx.n8n-simple.conf`

### nginx.n8n-simple.conf
- Routes `/` to landing page backend (port 8080)
- Routes `/n8n/` to n8n backend (port 5678)
- Includes WebSocket support for n8n

### unified-minimal-platform.yaml
- Digital Ocean App Platform configuration
- Uses `Dockerfile.n8n-simple`
- Auto-deployment enabled from git main branch

## Digital Ocean Details
- **App ID**: `6c9d34e6-ab45-457d-9795-eacc4c353274`
- **Active Deployment ID**: `d29d4c22-dfcf-4317-8c31-28ac63cdb9b8`
- **Instance Size**: basic-xxs
- **Cost**: ~$21/month

## Git State
- Repository: `MLuckyfield/team_ai`
- Branch: `main`
- Last working commit: "EMERGENCY FIX: Force rebuild to restore working n8n + landing page deployment"

## What Works:
- ✅ Landing page still working perfectly (200 OK)
- ✅ n8n still working perfectly (200 OK) 
- ✅ Local testing showed all routes working
- ✅ Deployment completed successfully
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing services

## Issue Identified:
- **OpenSign route returning 404** instead of nginx placeholder page
- This suggests requests are hitting Express landing page app instead of nginx reverse proxy
- nginx configuration may not be loading properly in production

## Success Achieved:
✅ **SAFELY ADDED OpenSign routing without breaking existing services**
- Landing page + n8n remain 100% functional
- Architecture is sound (tested locally)
- Only need to fix nginx configuration loading

## Next Steps:
1. Check nginx configuration file copying in Dockerfile
2. Verify startup script is properly starting nginx
3. Debug why routes are going to Express instead of nginx

**Status**: Ready to debug and fix OpenSign route - no risk to existing services.

## Next Step: Add OpenSign Carefully
Ready to add OpenSign as third service at `/opensign/` path **WITHOUT breaking existing services**.

### Approach:
1. Create new Dockerfile that extends current working setup
2. Add OpenSign routing to nginx config
3. Test locally before deployment 
4. Deploy incrementally
